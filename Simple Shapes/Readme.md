# Simple Shapes

Some examples of simple shapes (triangle, square, ... hexagon), that are then built on (repetition + rotation) to make "snow flakes."

A reference handout is included ([Libre Office Version](./Simple%20Shapes%20Handout.odt), [pdf version](./Simple%20Shapes%20Handout.pdf).)

Note: math blocks were excluded from the basic shapes to keep things as simple as possible.

TODO:

* Add an example that uses variables to create any regular polygon
* A recipe for the "intermediate" example; it's not easy/reliable to define the sub-stacks (functions) and parameters
